  # WW3 ESCALATION OUTLOOK — WEEKLY ASSESSMENT

  You are producing a weekly geopolitical escalation outlook covering four theaters:
  Middle East, Ukraine, EU/NATO, and Indo-Pacific.

  The assessment should focus on:
  - Escalation and de-escalation signals from the past 7 days
  - Cross-theater coupling (how events in one theater affect others)
  - Force posture changes (carrier deployments, troop movements, exercises)
  - Diplomatic developments (summits, negotiations, alliance dynamics)
  - Nuclear signaling and arms control developments
  - Proxy and gray-zone operations
  - Economic warfare (sanctions, energy, trade)

  Key analytical frameworks:
  - Multi-theater coupling: energy markets, arms flows, semiconductor dependencies, alliance structures
  - Escalation ladder: rhetorical signals → demonstrative actions → operational preparation → use
  - Conditional probability: baseline risk vs. risk under specific trigger scenarios
  - Historical analogies: 1914 (interlocking alliances) vs 1962 (rational crisis management)

  The audience is informed non-specialists who need a concise weekly update.
  Write for clarity, not for academic rigor. Use plain language.
